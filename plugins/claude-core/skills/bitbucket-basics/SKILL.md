# bitbucket-basics

Bitbucket operations via the Atlassian MCP server. Covers PR lifecycle, pipeline
monitoring, and code review actions.

## MCP requirement

This skill requires the Atlassian MCP server. If it is not available:

> "The Atlassian MCP server is not connected. To use Bitbucket operations, add
> the server to your MCP config and restart Claude Code. See references/process.md
> for setup instructions."

Do not attempt to substitute with REST calls or fabricate results.

## Operations

| Operation | MCP tool | Key inputs |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Create PR | `create_pull_request` | workspace, repo, title, source, target, description |
| List open PRs | `list_pull_requests` | workspace, repo, state=OPEN |
| Check pipeline | `get_pipeline` / `list_pipeline_steps` | workspace, repo, pipeline_uuid |
| Add PR comment | `create_pull_request_comment` | workspace, repo, pr_id, content |
| Approve PR | `approve_pull_request` | workspace, repo, pr_id |
| Branch ops | `create_branch` / `delete_branch` | workspace, repo, branch name |

## Key rules

- Always resolve workspace slug from `git remote -v` before asking the user.
- PR descriptions must follow the structured template in `references/process.md`.
- Report pipeline failures with step-level detail — overall "FAILED" is not enough.
- Never approve a PR in the same session that created it.
- Destructive ops (branch delete, PR decline) require explicit user confirmation.

## Process

Full workflows, error handling, and anti-patterns: `references/process.md`.
